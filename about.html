						<h2><u><i> Hyperautomation </i></u></h2><br/> <!-- sub heading for paragraph -->
							<p>Hyperautomation is the combination of multiple machine learning, packaged software and automation tools to deliver work and it deals with the application of advanced technologies including AI and machine learning to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. In simpler terms, hyperautomation is a mixture of automation technologies and artificial intelligence that, when combined, augment humans’ capabilities, allowing them to complete processes faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors. It increases the capabilities and workloads of extremely advanced technology while minimising or reducing the work of human labour to run your business processes all around more asuccessfully. <br/><br/>To grasp a thorough understanding of hyperautomation, click <a href="https://www.leapwork.com/blog/hyperautomation-what-why-how"> here  </a></p>

						<h2><u><i> Multiexperience </i></u></h2><br/> <!-- sub heading for paragraph -->
							<p> Multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective. User experiences in the industry of technology started with basic web pages. In the wake of android and iOS in 2007 via mobile phones came a new user experience through mobile applications. However the tech world has far improved and advanced since then which brings us to date in a world with multiexpereince. Organizations have broader requirements for use cases that involve developing experiences beyond that of just mobile or web apps. It focuses on creating solutions that seamlessly adapt from smartphone or laptop to wearables, or even audio-controlled devices. Whatever device, platform, it should provide a smooth, native result. That’s the multiexperience. Enterprises are beginning to be pushed towards creating a multiexperience platform for their users and customers. We can now afford to use touch and voice regocnition to control our devices. The ability to live chat customer support on a website has become the norm. Virtual and augmented reality has become a standard form of entertainment. The development of multiexpereince platforms is only going to become more exciting as the tech world is driven more and more down this path. <br/><br/>A good blog explaining multimedia experience can be read <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/jason-wong/multiexperience-development-has-arrived/">here</a></p><br/><br/>

						<h2><u><i> Distributed Cloud </i></u></h2><br/> <!-- sub heading for paragraph -->
							<p>A distributed cloud refers to having computation, storage, and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud. It is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations. It  generalizes the cloud computing model to position, process, and serve data and applications from geographically distributed sites to meet requirements for performance, redundancy and regulations. A distributed cloud is an execution environment where application components are placed at appropriate geographically-dispersed locations chosen to meet the requirements of the application. These requirements include location, regulations, security and redundancy. The distributed cloud service provider ensures the end-to-end management for the optimal placement of data, computing processes, and network interconnections based on these requirements. <br/><br/>To learn more about distributed cloud computing, click <a href="https://www.stackpath.com/edge-academy/distributed-cloud-computing/">here</a></p>
